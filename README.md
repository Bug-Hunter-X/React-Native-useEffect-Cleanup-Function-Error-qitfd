This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's `useEffect` hook: errors thrown by the cleanup function during component unmount.  The `useEffectCleanupBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `useEffectCleanupSolution.js` provides a solution to prevent this error.  The error arises from attempting to access stale state or props within the cleanup function after the component has unmounted.
